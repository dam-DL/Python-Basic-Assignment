12) Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

13) If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

# Assignment_3

1) Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?

2) When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?

3) What statement creates a function?

4) What is the difference between a function and a function call?

5) How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?

6) What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?

7) What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?

8) If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?

9) How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?

10) What is the data type of None?

11) What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?

12) If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?

# Assignment_4

1) What exactly is []?

2) In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? 
   (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.) Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.

3) What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?

4) What is the value of spam[-1]?

5) What is the value of spam[:2]? Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.

6) What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?

7) How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?

8) How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?

9) What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?

10) What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?

11) What are the two methods for removing items from a list?

12) Describe how list values and string values are identical.

13) What's the difference between tuples and lists?

14) How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?

15) How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?

16) Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?

17) How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
